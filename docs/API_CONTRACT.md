# API_CONTRACT.md

Base prefix: `/api/v1`

This contract is intentionally scaffold-level. It defines the route surface, access expectations, and example payloads so backend and frontend work can proceed in parallel.

## Status Labels

- `MVP`: should exist in the core project delivery
- `Later`: useful but can wait until MVP is stable
- `Org-only`: authenticated org/workspace context required
- `Admin`: platform admin or reviewer role required

## Contract Notes

- `scan-jobs` represents asynchronous execution even though the current scaffold runs inline.
- `public-threats` must remain identity-safe.
- `reports` are private workspace artifacts.
- `integrations/public-threats-api` is a planned phase-2 surface, not an MVP commitment.
